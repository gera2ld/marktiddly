Welcome to MarkTiddly!

This is a combination of [[Markdown]] and [[TiddlyWiki]]. See? Other Markdown files (or tiddlers) can easily be linked. And [[this]] is a non-existent link.

It allows you to render Markdown files as tiddlers in [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) and visit them in a Zettelkasten way.

## Why?

Because writing in Markdown is comfortable. TiddlyWiki is good at managing my notes but it doesn't have a good enough editor for writing Markdown.

So I created this tool to enjoy them both. I write Markdown with [Zettlr](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr) and publish them as a single HTML TiddlyWiki flavor website.

## Usage

```bash
$ npx marktiddly --cwd my-docs -o output.html
$ open output.html
```
